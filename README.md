## Ensemble Model: Hotel Bookings

### Background
The dataset comprises 119,390 hotel records, with each record representing a single booking. The dataset, sourced from Kaggle, includes various attributes such as booking details, guest information, and reservation status. Detailed descriptions of all variables can be accessed via the following link: Hotel Booking Cancellation Prediction Dataset

### Objective
The primary objective of this analysis is to apply ensemble machine learning methods to discern the importance of different factors in predicting hotel booking cancellations. By leveraging various models, we aim to develop a robust predictive framework capable of accurately determining whether a booking will be canceled or not.

### Methodology
1. **Data Preprocessing**: Perform data cleaning, feature engineering, and handling of missing values to prepare the dataset for analysis. This may involve encoding categorical variables, scaling numerical features, and addressing class imbalance.
2. **Ensemble Modeling**: Utilize ensemble learning techniques such as Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and AdaBoost to build predictive models. Ensemble methods combine multiple base learners to improve predictive performance and generalization.
3. **Model Evaluation**: Assess the performance of ensemble models using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC. Conduct cross-validation to validate model robustness and mitigate overfitting.

### Importance of Analysis
Understanding the determinants of hotel booking cancellations is essential for optimizing revenue management strategies and enhancing customer satisfaction. By accurately predicting booking cancellations, hotels can proactively manage inventory, optimize pricing strategies, and allocate resources effectively. Moreover, insights derived from the analysis can inform targeted interventions aimed at reducing cancellation rates and maximizing revenue potential.
